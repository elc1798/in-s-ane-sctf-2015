The .sid file extension signifies a sound file used by the Commodore 64. The title, author, and
release date have all been redacted, so simply opening up the song in a music player (such as audacious) will
not work. Instead, since there was really no other way to get the name of the song, I decided to
search in this nice database provided by HVSC (http://www.hvsc.c64.org/). The database is gigantic, and
there are a ton of songs, which makes it difficult to listen to each and every one of them for a match.
Instead, I chose to grep for some data in mystery.sid, and see if any song in the database contains
that data.

A match is found in Berggreen_I_Am.sid, giving us the name of the song.
