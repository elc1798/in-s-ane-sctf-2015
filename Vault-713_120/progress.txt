First input must have an even length
Must be hex characters
Runs ord() on something in the first input
Seems to output "You done f**ked up." if the thing throws an error
Page is written in php
Inputting "" or '' or two spaces in the first input seems to ignore them

Decodes hex, then runs ord() on output.
